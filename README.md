# SpaceColonies

This Java program simulates the population relocation onto other planets and uses ArrayQueues and certain qualifications(skills, preferences etc.) to determine the best way to repopulate new planets. It will draw comparisions between each person and take into account the current planet state/capacity to make the best decision.
